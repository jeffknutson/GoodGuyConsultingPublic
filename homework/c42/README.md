This is the homework project for Code42.

Requirements - Web Engineer exercise
Create a single page application using a modern JavaScript library or framework. Examples include
but are not limited to: React, Ember.js, Vue.js. In addition, leverage an HTTP client library, such as
jQuery.ajax, github/fetch, or what's included within your framework.
For this single page app, create a sidebar and main content areas. This is a typical master-detail
view application.
In the sidebar, list each member of the Code42 organization using the public Github API.
When you click on a member in the sidebar, the main content area should populate with that
person's information. For each person, show the following relevant information from their profile.
• Their Github image
• A list of their repos
• Their public location
• Their public email
• Their join date
Extra credit:
• Additional details for each Code42 Member
• Their total number of contributions in the last year
• The organizations to which they belong
• A list of repos they have contributed to
• Well-styled: feel free to use a css library including bootstrap, material design, foundation or a similar
style framework.
• The back button works
• The sidebar and main content views could have loading states while data is being fetched from the
server
• Tests


- I chose React as the JavaScript library; it is what I'm currently working with.
- I chose Cory House's React Slingshot starter kit to get this project started.  I've seen his React course on Pluralsight and liked his style.
