Here are some of the cmdlets we used while discussing background jobs

Start-Job -ScriptBlock { 
    Start-Sleep -Seconds 20; #simulates a long running process
    Get-EventLog -LogName Application -ComputerName localhost -Newest 10;
}

Get-Job   # you can use the ID provided in the Start-Job response 

#let's pretend the Job id is 1

Receive-Job -Id 1

- or -

Receive-Job -Id 1 -Keep  #this will keep the data in the result so you can retrieve it in Receive-job another time


Stop-Job -Id 1  # this stops a currently running job

Remove-Job -Id 1  # this removes a job
